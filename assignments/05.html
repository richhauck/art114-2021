<p>Alternatively, if your design includes a carousel, you can assemble a working version of that. Consider using a library like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-responsive-touch-friendly-carousels-with-flickity/" target="_blank">Flickity</a>, <a href="https://swiperjs.com/">Swiper</a>, or <a href="https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="_blank">Slick</a>.</p>
<p>The assignment will be due at the beginning of next class. Post the final submission to [yourwebsite]/assignments/05</p>
